The Drupal OpenLayers project creates a set of modules that integrates the OpenLayers JS library with Drupal. It provides a set of features and functionality that allow users to create dynamic and unique looking maps on their site.
Why OpenLayers?

OpenLayers provides the code flexibility of open source, and the extensibility of being able to handle a huge amount of GIS data formats. OpenLayers also excels at providing an input for geospatial features.
